This is Stage 4. We learn the importance of limiting the amount of dependencies our program needs. Video is just a bunch of screen caps. Knowing this fact, we apply some looping methods and error checks. Furthermore, we make our program able to hook onto any window name we give it. We apply some OOP principles, introducing classes, functions, and the self parameter. Lastly, we focus on lowering the frame rate of our screen capture method. Win32 offers the least dependencies in this regard.
